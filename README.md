# Sales Commission Managment Application

This project is implemented by the undergraduate students: -Ilias Papathanasiou -Konstantinos Papadopoulos

For the Software Development course MYE004 of the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science And Engineering course of the University of Ioannina.

<b> Objective </b>

In this project, our objective was to enhance the quality and maintainability of a sales and commission management application by addressing various coding issues. We applied several key refactorings to handle 
problems such as code duplication and the presence of underused or "lazy" classes. 
By implementing these refactorings, we improved the codebase's structure, making it more organized, efficient, and easier to understand. 
The result is a more reliable and maintainable application that provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and reduces the risk of potential bugs or errors related to code duplication and unutilized classes.
