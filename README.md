# Sales Commission Managment Application

This project is implemented by the undergraduate students: -Ilias Papathanasiou -Konstantinos Papadopoulos

For the Software Development course MYE004 of the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science And Engineering course of the University of Ioannina.

<b> Objective </b>

In this project, our objective was to enhance the quality and maintainability of a sales and commission management application by addressing various coding issues. We applied several key refactorings to handle 
problems such as code duplication and the presence of underused or "lazy" classes. 
By implementing these refactorings, we improved the codebase's structure, making it more organized, efficient, and easier to understand. 
The result is a more reliable and maintainable application that provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and reduces the risk of potential bugs or errors related to code duplication and unutilized classes.

<b> Branches </b>

The repository utilizes a two-branch strategy to manage the development and introduction of improvements to the project:
      <li> <b> Main Branch: </b> This branch contains the original version of the project, serving as the base codebase. It is intended for users who require the initial, untouched version of the software for various purposes. </li>
<li> <b> Improvements Branch: </b> The improvements branch is where we address and fix issues identified in the main branch. While this branch is primarily focused on resolving problems rather than introducing new features or significant enhancements, it serves as the most up-to-date version of the project, incorporating all known fixes. Users seeking the most stable version of the project, with known issues addressed, should refer to this branch. </li>
